FileAccess:
	1) A try/catch block is a structure that attempts to detect
	   exceptions thrown within the try portion of the block. The
	   catch portions all contain code to deal with possibly
	   thrown exceptions. We need a try/catch block in this file
	   to deal with the possibility that the file we are trying
	   to read does not exist.
	   
	2) In general, an exception is any event that disrupts the 
	   normal flow of a program. In Java an exception is an
	   object that contains information about the error that
	   is thrown (including its type). 
	   
Workouts:
	1) We chose ArrayList because it allows us to access the
	   list of workout values in parallel from multiple threads
	   because it is not synchronized (as opposed to a Vector,
	   which is synchronized). Additionally, ArrayList grows
	   slower which leads to less overhead, which is preferable
	   because we will not be dealing with a large enough 
	   amount of workouts to make the faster growth of a Vector
	   desirable.
	
	2) The enum did not need to be declared static because
	   each version of the Workouts class needs to get its
	   own copy of the enums. 

	3) We use an inner class in order to control access to the
	   data members and methods that are used within the 
	   Workout object. This leads to better encapsulation
	   
	4) We get the name of an enum value by using either name
	   or toString functions
	   
	5) Short-circuit evaluation is when an operator does not 
	   necessarily evaluate all of its operands. In Java, the
	   short-circuit AND is && and the short-circuit OR is ||.
